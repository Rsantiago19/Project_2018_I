README PARALLEL VERSION

MAKEFILE:

Type "make" to compile everything
Type "make run-main" to run the MD simulation in ../test_dir and 2 threads by default. 
	To change default values: "make run-main num_procs=# dir_name='your/dir/'"
Type "make run-rdf" to run the RDF computation program.
Type "make run-MB" to perform the checking the velocity distribution
	(This two commands must be executed AFTER running MD.
	But the Makefile already have this feature into account.
	Default options for "run-main" apply to "make run-rdf" and "make run-MB" too)
Type "make clean" to remove *.o, *.mod, *.xyz, *.out and the exec files.
Type "make backup" to create a backup directory with the *.f90 files.
Type "make help" to show the aviable options.


MD: 

The input file must contain this parameters in the same order.

dt              (seconds)
density         (sigma's)
cutOff          (pm --> corresponds to 2.5 times sigma)
nPartDim        (Adimensional)
T*              (T*Kb/eps)
eps             (Epsilon/Kb)
sig             (pm)
nSteps          (Adimensional)
seed            (Adimensional)

In order to run explicitly the MD without using the Makefile it should be done as follows:
mpirun -np # dynamics_mpi input.dat

Be aware to have the module loaded!!!! It only works with gcc compilers, 
because the intel compilers do not have the built in rand() function.

PLOTS:

The *.gp scripts can be found in the Plots/ directory. To execute them, copy the desired script to the
holding MD directory. The exectue as: "gnuplot <script_name.gp>".
